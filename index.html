                <h5 class="w3-center">Aspiring Computer Programmer</h5>
                <p class="w3-large">Hi, my name is Cate Defa. I am currently a senior at Park City High School who
                    plans to major in Computer Science. I am a hardworking student with a passion for learning. </p>
                <p class="w3-large">Throughout my four years of high school I have taken various classes to further my
                    education including Programming 1, AP Computer Science Priciples, AP Computer Science A, and PCCAPS
                    App and Technology Solutions. These classes exposed me
                    to languages such as Python, Java, Java Script, and HTML. Additionally, through PCCAPS, I learned
                    effective communication skills and improved both my professionalism and collaborative skills.</p>
                <p class="w3-large"> Last summer, I also had the opportunity to participate in the Women Tech Council's
                    2-week "SheTech Explorer" summer
                    internship. I was able to speak directly with women working in Utah's tech industry and learned
                    about all the different STEM careers I can pursue in the future.</p>

                <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Being on various sports team as well as group projects has taught me a lot about
                    collaboration. When it comes to soccer, you must effectively work with ten other players in order
                    to win. Similarly, my PCCAPS project would not have been possible had it not been for the two other
                    peers that I worked with to complete it. </p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time, rather than trying to tackle it all at once. Through my various team/group experiences, I have learned the value in working with others
                    and splitting up tasks amongst group members.
                    Collaboration increases efficiency and creativity. There is no "i" in team.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Professionalism & Communication</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">PCCAPS involved weekly meetings with a client. I had to make sure I was always
                    prepared beforehand including having a detailed meeting presentation to present to them, dressing in
                    a professional manner, and acting and speaking in a mature manner. I also had to send
                    various emails to them over the course of the class. I learned valuable skills when it comes to
                    formatting a professional and formal email like using lots of bullet points and underlines.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Website for Pick Up PC</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">My PCCAPS project was to develop a website for Recycle Utah and their "Pick Up
                    PC" Program. To create the project I had to learn how to use GitHub, VS Code, HTML, and CSS. The
                    knowledge and skills I acquired from this class were immeasurable. I learned how to develop a
                    website, new coding languages, and to be self reliant when it comes to finding solutions to my
                    problems. I am excited to see how I can apply my newly acquired skills to all of my future endeavors
                    and projects!</p>

                <h4>Athletics</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">I play soccer and run track. I played competitive club soccer for 7 years and
                    all 4 years in highschool. I have also run track for the past 4 years competing in the 100, 200,
                    4x100, and 4x200. Outside of sports, I also enjoy hiking throughout my community with friends. I
                    have backpacked and canoed in California and Washington.</p><br>

                <h4>Volunteering</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">I regularly volunteer at the Kimball Art Center and Big Brothers Big Sisters.
                    Over the past five years at the KAC, I have assisted in leading art classes, event set up, and
                    volunteer management during the annual Kimball Arts Festival. I currently act as the point-person
                    between the organization and my high school and am responsible for spreading volunteering
                    opportunities to students. At BBBS, I work weekly with a 4th-grade student at one of our local
                    elemntary schools. I assist them with their homework and teach them good habits.</p><br>

                <h4>Clubs</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">I am on the board of the National Honor Society and Interact Club. Both are
                    volunteer based clubs and I assist in the organization of events and the creation of group
                    project for club members. I am also a member of Coding Club where I meet weekly with other students
                    to learn about new programming languages
                    and algorithims from a peer.</p><br>

                <h4>Awards</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Throughout highschool, I have received High Honor Roll every quarter by
                    obtaining a GPA of 3.7 or higher. During my junior year, I was awarded AP Scholar with Distinction
                    for receiving an average score of at least 3.5 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on
                    five or more of these exams. Most recently, I was awarded UHSAA Academic All-State 2022-23. This
                    award recognizes senior student-athletes with a 3.75 or higher cumulative GPA.</p><br>
